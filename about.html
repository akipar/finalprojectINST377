                <p>This page has a search feature to search your favorite Pokemon card by artist or pokemon name.<br>
                On the main home page, you can click on the pokemon card to display information.<br>
            On the Search Card page, you can search cards by your favorite artist or pokemon name. 
            When you click on the artist name or pokemon name from the result, it will search again automatically for having more result with your interest!</p>

                    <h2>What is the purpose of this page?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I made this page to have people more interested in the art of pokemon cards and be able to learn more about the artists of pokemon card.
                        <br><br>
                        Pokemon cards has been a target to scalpers who resell cards for high value based on what is rare and what is not.
                        <br><br>
                        But with this website, I wanted to bring more attention to the art of Pokemon card and not about what is price worthy.
                        <br>
                        I hope that you can find your favorite card from here, and make your collection online!
